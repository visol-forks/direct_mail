On the first line you may enter a comma-separated list of field names. This first line provides the structure for the records that follow. If you do not provide a list of field names on the first line, then the structure of the records is assumed to be "name, email".

Each field name listed on the first line is analyzed as follows:

1.the field name may one of the field names from the following list: uid, name, title, email, phone, www, address, company, city, zip, country, fax, module_sys_dmail_html, module_sys_dmail_category;

2.the field name may be omitted in which case the corresponding values will be skipped or omitted;

3.the field name may start with "user_", assuming that table tt_address was extended with the specified field name;

4.in addition, fields may be suffixed with "[code]"; in this case, when the value in the imported record is not null, "[+value]" adds that number to the field value and "[=value]" overrides any existing value in the field.
